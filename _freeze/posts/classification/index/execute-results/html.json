It involves categorizing data into predefined classes. In this post, we'll explore the basics of classification in machine learning using Python, a popular language in data science due to its simplicity and robust libraries.\n\n## Setting Up the Environment\n\nEnsure you have Python installed with the necessary libraries. We'll use `scikit-learn`, a powerful tool for machine learning in Python. Install it using pip if you haven't already:\n\n\n```{bash}\npip install scikit-learn\n```\n\n\n### Classification Basics\n\nClassification algorithms are used for tasks where the output variable is a category, such as \"spam\" or \"not spam\" in email filtering.\n\n### Types of Classification\n\n**Binary Classification:**\n\n",
